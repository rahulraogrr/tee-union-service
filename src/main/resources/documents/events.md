# Events Table Documentation

## Overview
The `events` table is designed to store information about various events organized by members. It includes details such as the event name, description, date, location, and the type of event.

---

## Table Structure

### **`events` Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE events
(
    id            BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    organizer_id  BIGINT       NOT NULL REFERENCES members (id),
    name          VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description   TEXT,
    event_date    TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL,
    location      VARCHAR(255),
    event_type_id BIGINT       NOT NULL REFERENCES event_types (id),
    created_at    TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at    TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Columns

| Column Name     | Data Type      | Constraints                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | `BIGSERIAL`    | `PRIMARY KEY`                        | Unique identifier for the event.                                            |
| `organizer_id`  | `BIGINT`       | `NOT NULL`, `REFERENCES members(id)` | ID of the member organizing the event.                                      |
| `name`          | `VARCHAR(255)` | `NOT NULL`                           | Name of the event.                                                          |
| `description`   | `TEXT`         |                                      | Detailed description of the event.                                          |
| `event_date`    | `TIMESTAMP`    | `NOT NULL`                           | Date and time when the event is scheduled to occur.                         |
| `location`      | `VARCHAR(255)` |                                      | Location where the event will take place.                                   |
| `event_type_id` | `BIGINT`       | `NOT NULL`, `REFERENCES event_types(id)` | ID of the event type (e.g., conference, webinar, workshop).                |
| `created_at`    | `TIMESTAMP`    | `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT NOW()`          | Timestamp when the event was created.                                       |
| `updated_at`    | `TIMESTAMP`    | `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT NOW()`          | Timestamp when the event was last updated.                                  |

## Relationships

- **`organizer_id`**: References the `members` table to associate the event with the member who organized it.
- **`event_type_id`**: References the `event_types` table to categorize the event (e.g., conference, webinar, workshop).

---

## Example Use Cases

### 1. **Creating an Event**
A member organizes a webinar on "Introduction to SQL" scheduled for December 15, 2023.

```sql
INSERT INTO events (organizer_id, name, description, event_date, location, event_type_id)
VALUES (1, 'Introduction to SQL', 'A beginner-friendly webinar on SQL basics.', '2023-12-15 14:00:00', 'Online', 2);
```

---

### 2. **Updating an Event**
The event location is changed from "Online" to "Conference Room A".

```sql
UPDATE events
SET location = 'Conference Room A', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### 3. **Fetching Events Organized by a Member**
Retrieve all events organized by a specific member (e.g., member with ID `1`).

```sql
SELECT id, name, event_date, location
FROM events
WHERE organizer_id = 1;
```

---

### 4. **Fetching Events by Type**
Retrieve all events of a specific type (e.g., webinar with `event_type_id = 2`).

```sql
SELECT id, name, event_date, location
FROM events
WHERE event_type_id = 2;
```

---

### 5. **Deleting an Event**
Delete an event that has been canceled (e.g., event with ID `1`).

```sql
DELETE FROM events
WHERE id = 1;
```

---

## Indexes

To improve query performance, consider adding the following indexes:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_events_organizer_id ON events (organizer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_event_type_id ON events (event_type_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_event_date ON events (event_date);
```

---

## Triggers

### **Automatically Update `updated_at` on Event Modification**
A trigger can be added to automatically update the `updated_at` timestamp whenever an event is modified.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_event_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS
$$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_event_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON events
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_event_timestamp();
```

---

## Example Data

### **`events` Table**

| id  | organizer_id | name                  | description                     | event_date           | location           | event_type_id | created_at           | updated_at           |
|-----|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1   | 1            | Introduction to SQL   | A beginner-friendly webinar.    | 2023-12-15 14:00:00  | Online             | 2             | 2023-11-01 10:00:00  | 2023-11-01 10:00:00  |

## Notes

1. **Soft Deletion**: If soft deletion is required, consider adding a `deleted_at` column to the `events` table.
2. **Validation**: Ensure that `event_date` is always in the future when creating or updating an event.
3. **Normalization**: If event descriptions are frequently updated, consider moving the `description` column to a separate table to reduce row size.
